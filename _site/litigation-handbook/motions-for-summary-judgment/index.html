<ol>
<li>Timing on Filing and Opposing Motions for Summary Judgment</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Meet and Confer Process</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>If the jurisdiction of the case does not automatically allow for at least two weeks to oppose the MSJ (Central District), then anticipate in advance that you’ll want two weeks to oppose any dispositive motion, and make that request in the Rule 26 scheduling conference report.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The Northern, Southern and Eastern Districts automatically allow for the two weeks to oppose. California courts automatically allow for several weeks to oppose.</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>In the ND, the opposition is due 14 days after the Motion is filed, and the Motion must be filed 35 days prior to the hearing date.</li>
<li>In the ED and SD, the opposition is due 14 days prior to the hearing date, and the Motion must be filed 28 days prior to the hearing date.</li>
<li>By contrast, in the CD, the opposition is due 21 days prior the hearing date, and the Motion must be filed 28 days prior to the hearing date.</li>
<li>It’s important to have 2 weeks to oppose because an MSJ opposition is a big project, and you’ll need time to get signatures on the declarations and have Dale review the opposition. You don’t want Dale to be making edits to the opposition on the day that it’s due.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Some districts, including the ND, SD, and ED, do not require the moving party to meet and confer with the opposing party prior to filing a motion. Fortunately, we automatically get 2 weeks to oppose in those districts.</li>
<li>In the Central District, the moving party must meet and confer with opposing counsel at least 7 days prior to filing the MSJ. During the meet and confer process, try to accomplish the following:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Establish a briefing schedule and agree on a stipulation to be filed with the court stating the hearing date and the filing dates for the motion, opposition, and reply. This briefing schedule should propose that you have two weeks to oppose the motion.</li>
<li>If the case is strong enough in our favor, suggest to opposing counsel that Plaintiffs are considering filing an affirmative MSJ, and ask whether the defense would be willing to forego filing their MSJ if we would also agree not to file an MSJ.</li>
<li>Consider which of our claims are the weakest. Inquire whether the defense would forgo filing an MSJ on the use of force if we agree to dismiss our claims for unreasonable detention and arrest, interference with familial relations, and Monell.</li>
<li>CD L.R. 7-3 Conference of Counsel Prior to Filing of Motions. “In all cases not listed as exempt in L.R. 16-12, and except in connection with discovery motions (which are governed by L.R. 37-1 through 37-4) and applications for temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions, counsel contemplating the filing of any motion shall first contact opposing counsel to discuss thoroughly, preferably in person, the substance of the contemplated motion and any potential resolution. The conference shall take place at least seven (7) days prior to the filing of the motion. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution which eliminates the necessity for a hearing, counsel for the moving party shall include in the notice of motion a statement to the following effect: This motion is made following the conference of counsel pursuant to L.R. 7-3 which took place on (date).”</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Procedural Posture of Case at Time of Filing</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The MSJ will typically be filed after all experts have been exchanged and preferably deposed. However, the defense could spring an early MSJ on you,</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>so you want to make sure that you depose the involved officers within the first month or so of discovery, and make sure you get your experts involved early on.</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The scheduling order should give a date for the last day for motions to be heard. Keep any eye on that date. Calendar 35, 42 and 49 days prior to that date. In the CD, you want to either start working on the motion early or reach out to meet and confer on the motion early. If you wait until 35 days prior to the last day for the court to hear motions to meet and confer, then defense counsel will argue that he can’t stipulate to an extended briefing schedule because doing so would be to ask the court to change its scheduling order.</li>
<li>“[S]ummary judgment [must] be refused where the nonmoving party has not had the opportunity to discover information that is essential to his opposition.” Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250 n. 5 (1986); Celotex Corp.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986); Nader v. Blair, 549 F.3d 953, 961 (4th Cir. 2008); see also Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d) (“if a nonmovant shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to . . . take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.”). Sufficient time for discovery is “considered especially important when the relevant facts are exclusively in the control of the opposing party.” Harrods Ltd. v. Sixty Internet Domain Names, 302 F.3d 214, 246-47 (4th Cir. 2002).</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Central District Local Rules</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The default rule in the Central District is that an MSJ must be filed 28 days prior to the hearing date, like any other motion in the CD. If you do not meet and confer early on to get an extra week to oppose, then you would need to file an ex parte application for additional time during the same week that you’re working on the opposition.</li>
<li>Some CD judges have recognized that parties need more time to oppose MSJ. For example, Birotte’s webpage states: “Rule 56 Motions: Must be noticed, served, and filed not later than 35 days before the hearing date so that the</li>
</ol>
</li>

<ol>
<li>CD L.R. 56-1 Documents Required From Moving Party.</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>A party filing a notice of motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment shall lodge a proposed “Statement of Uncontroverted Facts and Conclusions of Law.” Such proposed statement shall set forth the material facts as to which the moving party contends there is no genuine dispute.</li>
<li>A party seeking summary judgment shall lodge a proposed Judgment; a party seeking partial summary judgment shall lodge a proposed Order.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>L.R. 56-2 Statement of Genuine Disputes of Material Fact by Opposing Party. Any party who opposes the motion shall serve and file with the opposing papers a separate document containing a concise “Statement of Genuine Disputes” setting forth all material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine dispute necessary to be litigated.</li>
<li>L.R. 56-3 Determination of Motion. In determining any motion for summary judgment or partial summary judgment, the Court may assume that the material facts as claimed and adequately supported by the moving party are admitted to exist without controversy except to the extent that such material facts are (a) included in the “Statement of Genuine Disputes” and (b) controverted by declaration or other written evidence filed in opposition to the motion.</li>

<li>SD LR Time for Hearing and Schedule for Filing Papers</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Twenty-eight (28) Day Rule—Setting Time for Hearing. When there has been an adverse appearance, a written notice of a matter requiring the court's ruling is necessary, unless otherwise provided by rule or court order. Pursuant to the provisions of Civil Local Rule 7.1.b, all hearing dates for any motion must be obtained from the law clerk of the judge to whom the case is assigned. Unless the court shortens time and except as otherwise specified in Civil Local Rule 7.1.e.6, any motion, application or notice of other matter requiring the court's ruling, plus all necessary supporting documents, will require a minimum filing date of twenty-eight (28) days prior to the date for which the matter is noticed. (For example, the motion and supporting documents for a motion to be heard on a Monday must be filed and served no later than the fourth (4th) Monday prior to the Monday hearing. If the fourth Monday prior to the Monday hearing is a holiday, however, then the motion and supporting documents would be due five (5) Fridays before the hearing.)</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Time for filing opposition. Except as otherwise specified in Civil Local Rule 7.1.e.1, each party opposing a motion, application or order to show cause must file that opposition or statement of non-opposition with the clerk and serve the movant or the movant's attorney not later than fourteen (14) calendar days prior to the noticed hearing. (For example, for a motion to be heard on a Monday, the opposition papers must be filed and served no later than two Mondays prior to the noticed hearing.)</li>
<li>Reply Memorandum of Points and Authorities. Except as otherwise specified in Civil Local Rule 7.1.e.1, any reply memorandum must be filed and served not later than seven (7) days prior to the date for which the matter is noticed. (For example, for a hearing, the reply papers must be filed and served no later than by the Monday prior to the hearing. If the Monday prior to the hearing is a holiday, however, then the reply papers would be due two (2) Fridays prior to the hearing.) See Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(e).</li>

<li>
<ol>
<li>(a) (1) A party may move for summary judgment in an action or proceeding if it is contended that the action has no merit or that there is no defense to the action or proceeding. The motion may be made at any time after 60 days have elapsed since the general appearance in the action or proceeding of each party against whom the motion is directed or at any earlier time after the general appearance that the court, with or without notice and upon good cause shown, may direct.</li>
<li>(2) Notice of the motion and supporting papers shall be served on all other parties to the action at least 75 days before the time appointed for hearing.</li>

<ol>
<li>(b) (1) The motion shall be supported by affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken. The supporting papers shall include a separate statement setting forth plainly and concisely all material facts that the moving party contends are undisputed. Each of the material facts stated shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. The failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may in the court’s discretion constitute a sufficient ground for denying the motion.</li>
<li>(2) An opposition to the motion shall be served and filed not less than 14 days preceding the noticed or continued date of hearing, unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. The opposition, where appropriate, shall consist of affidavits, declarations, admissions, answers to interrogatories, depositions, and matters of which judicial notice shall or may be taken.</li>
<li>(3) The opposition papers shall include a separate statement that responds to each of the material facts contended by the moving party to be undisputed, indicating if the opposing party agrees or disagrees that those facts are undisputed. The statement also shall set forth plainly and concisely any other material facts the opposing party contends are disputed. Each material fact contended by the opposing party to be disputed shall be followed by a reference to the supporting evidence. Failure to comply with this requirement of a separate statement may constitute a sufficient ground, in the court’s discretion, for granting the motion.</li>

<li>Per California Court Rule 3.1350:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Motion for summary adjudication. If made in the alternative, a motion for summary adjudication may make reference to and depend on the same evidence submitted in support of the summary judgment motion. If summary adjudication is sought, whether separately or as an alternative to the motion for summary judgment, the specific cause of action, affirmative defense, claims for damages, or issues of duty must be stated specifically in the notice of motion and be repeated, verbatim, in the separate statement of undisputed material facts.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Documents in support of motion</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Except as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(r) and rule 3.1351, the motion must contain and be supported by the following documents:</li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Notice of motion by [moving party] for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both;</li>
<li>Separate statement of undisputed material facts in support of [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both;</li>
<li>Memorandum in support of [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both;</li>
<li>Evidence in support of [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both; and</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The Separate Statement of Undisputed Material Facts in support of a motion must separately identify:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Each cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion; and</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2.  Each supporting material fact claimed to be without dispute with respect to the cause of action, claim for damages, issue of duty, or affirmative defense that is the subject of the motion.
3.  The separate statement should include only material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent to the disposition of the motion.
4.  The separate statement must be in the two-column format specified in (h). The statement must state in numerical sequence the undisputed material facts in the first column followed by the evidence that establishes those undisputed facts in that same column. Citation to the evidence in support of each material fact must include reference to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.
11.  Except as provided in Code of Civil Procedure section 437c(r) and rule 3.1351, the opposition to a motion must consist of the following separate documents, titled as shown:
12.  1.  [Opposing party's] memorandum in opposition to [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both;
2.  [Opposing party's] separate statement in opposition to [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both;
3.  [Opposing party's] evidence in opposition to [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both (if appropriate); and
4.  [Opposing party's] request for judicial notice in opposition to [moving party's] motion for summary judgment or summary adjudication or both (if appropriate).
13.  The Separate Statement in Opposition to Motion must be in the two-column format specified in (h).
14.  1.  Each material fact claimed by the moving party to be undisputed must be set out verbatim on the left side of the page, below which must be set out the evidence said by the moving party to establish that fact, complete with the moving party's references to exhibits.
2.  On the right side of the page, directly opposite the recitation of the moving party's statement of material facts and supporting evidence, the response must unequivocally state whether that fact is &quot;disputed&quot; or &quot;undisputed.&quot; An opposing party who contends that a fact is disputed must state, on the right side of the page directly opposite the fact in dispute, the nature of the dispute and describe the evidence that supports the position that the fact is controverted. Citation to the evidence in support of the position that a fact is controverted must include reference to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.
3.  If the opposing party contends that additional material facts are pertinent to the disposition of the motion, those facts must be set forth in the separate statement. The separate statement should include only material facts and not any facts that are not pertinent to the disposition of the motion. Each fact must be followed by the evidence that establishes the fact. Citation to the evidence in support of each material fact must include reference to the exhibit, title, page, and line numbers.
15.  Affirmative MSJ
16.  1.  Filing an affirmative MSJ (an MSJ filed on behalf of the Plaintiffs) can imply to the judge that your case is particularly strong. While it’s unlikely that the judge would grant the affirmative MSJ, it can neutralize the defendants’ MSJ.
2.  Some judges only allow one MSJ to be filed in the case. If your case is strong enough that Plaintiffs are considering filing an MSJ, then check your judge’s procedures. For example, Judge Birotte’s webpage states:
3.  1.  “The Court will allow only one motion for summary judgment per party in this case, and will not entertain cross-motions. Counsel shall meet and confer prior to summary judgment to determine which party will be the moving party and which will be the opposing party on summary judgment. To the extent it is appropriate based on undisputed facts and controlling principles of law, the Court will sua sponte enter summary judgment in favor of the non-moving party pursuant to Rule 56(f). If any party believes this is one of the rare instances in which there is good cause to allow more than one summary judgment motion (including a cross-motion) or to increase page limits on the moving papers, the party shall seek leave from the court by a noticed motion setting forth good cause.”
17.  Documents Comprising the Motion and Opposition
18.  1.  Memorandum of Points and Authorities
2.  Separate Statement
3.  1.  Not permitted in the ND
2.  Required in the CD and ED
3.  Typically jointly filed in the ED with respect to the reply statement
4.  Expert Declarations
5.  1.  Draft the expert declaration based on the expert’s report.
2.  Consult with the expert to fill in any gaps in your argument.
3.  If you do not have direct evidence of a fact, put the fact in the expert’s declaration.
4.  If you do not have direct testimony, have the expert state in his declaration that he reviewed hearsay statements, making the documents admissible.
6.  Witness Declarations
7.  1.  If you do not have deposition testimony of a key witness, draft a declaration stating the points you need to survive MSJ and get the witness to sign it.
8.  Exhibits
9.  1.  Deposition transcripts
2.  1.  Highlight the relevant pages.
2.  In the ED, you must lodge the entire transcript.
3.  Trajectory photographs
4.  Officer statements
5.  1.  May need to be filed under seal.
2.  Seek a stipulation to file the exhibits under seal early. Do not wait until the last minute. Figure out which evidence you are going to rely on early on so you can meet and confer with defense counsel.
6.  Videos of the incident
10.  Declaration of the drafting attorney attaching Exhibits
19.  Drafting the Separate Statement
20.  1.  Start by gathering our best evidence. Review and highlight the key depo transcripts and the initial interviews. Do a good job highlighting (in Adobe) as you go so you don’t dump this task on your support staff at the last minute.
2.  Plaintiffs’ Additional Material Facts. (PAMF). Create a table that lists our best facts in chronological order in the left side column and lists the citation (e.g., “Starks Depo. at 13:5-14:6 (describing that he held the gun in his right hand)). Use parentheticals where appropriate.
3.  Organize the facts into categories, such as:
4.  1.  Background of the Incident
2.  The Incident
3.  Standards on the Use of Deadly Force
4.  The Shooting was Excessive and Unreasonable
5.  The Officers’ Training
6.  Monell Liability
5.  Compare your facts with Ds’ facts. Delete any facts you have that are redundant, provided that Ds’ fact on that issue is phrased in a neutral way. The court doesn’t want our PAMF to be too long or redundant.
6.  Ask the defense for a Word version of their Separate Statement (“SS”). If they don’t get back to you promptly, have your support staff create a Word version of Ds’ SS.
7.  1.  Transfer the citations in the righthand column of Ds’ SS to the left side column underneath Ds’ evidence. In the righthand column, which is now blank, go through and see what objections you can make, such as:
2.  1.  Not relevant under FRE 401, 402 and Graham
2.  Compound
3.  Calls for speculation and lacks foundation
4.  Relies on inadmissible expert opinion
5.  Vague and ambiguous, including as to time
3.  Don’t go too heavy on the objections. Only object where it really matters so you don’t lose credibility with the court.
4.  Go through your PAMF and determine which PAMFs dispute which of Ds’ facts. Copy/paste your PAMFs into the righthand column of Ds’ SS. Each fact will be evaluated individually upon a potential appeal. It may seem redundant, but in each righthand box per each of Ds’ facts, copy/paste all PAMF that dispute that fact. There are typically 8 or so facts set forth by Ds as “undisputed” that are basically “the whole case.” Go heavy with your disputes on those facts.
5.  As you dispute Ds’ facts, you may find that you need additional evidence to dispute their important facts that you didn’t put in your PAMF. If you add an important dispute to Ds’ facts in that righthand column, it’s probably important enough to also add to your PAMF, so be sure to do that. Remember to utilize declarations from experts and percipient witnesses to create the evidence you need to dispute Ds’ facts.
8.  The PAMF will become part of the SS chart but sometimes it’s easier to start it as a separate document. Copy/paste your PAMF at the bottom of Ds’ SS when you’re done.</p>
