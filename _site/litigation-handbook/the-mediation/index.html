<h1>Selecting the Type of Mediation</h1>
<ul>
<li>In the Central District, discuss the following options during the Early Meeting of Counsel:</li>
<li>Attorney Settlement Panel—first three hours are free
<ul>
<li>Private Mediation</li>
<li>Magistrate Judge</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Indicate your selection in the joint scheduling conference report. If selecting the attorney settlement panel, contact Rick Copeland or your selected mediator for consent, and then complete and file form ADR-02</li>
<li>In the Northern and Southern Districts, an ENE may be held. This is an early neutral evaluation conference wherein a judge will offer his/her neutral evaluation of the case with the evidence currently available. Settlement may or may not be discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Scheduling the Mediation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Consider the procedural posture of the case. Key settlement times include:</li>
<li>Early settlement discussions occurring prior to the parties incurring the costs of retaining experts.
<ul>
<li>If you do not anticipate a large recovery on your case, you would not want to run up your costs. (e.g., a case where the cause of death is disputed, and you need to retain medical experts).
<ul>
<li>By contrast, in a high-value case where the plaintiff survived the shooting and we intend to retain a life care planner and an economist, the mediation may be more productive after the expert discovery period.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Settlement discussions occurring when cross MSJs are pending and the parties have an equal risk of the MSJ being decided in the other party’s favor.</li>
<li>Settlement discussions occurring after an order denying Ds’ MSJ where Ds do not file an interlocutory appeal.</li>
<li>Settlement discussions within the weeks and even days before trial before incurring the cost and risk of a jury trial.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>The Mediation Brief</h1>
<ul>
<li>Timing: one week prior to the mediation.</li>
<li>Confidentiality: typically sent only to the mediator.</li>
<li>Contents:</li>
<li>Relevant facts
<ul>
<li>Relevant law</li>
<li>Candid evaluation of Plaintiffs’ likelihood of prevailing on their claims</li>
<li>Explanation of Plaintiffs’ damages (particularly important where the Plaintiff injured survived)</li>
<li>Plaintiffs’ goals (to settle the case)</li>
<li>A section on Dale’s recent verdicts and attorney fee awards, as well as reference to your own attorney fee awards, if any</li>
<li>The demand, which is about 2-3 times more than what you’d be satisfied walking away with.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attachments: any videos, photos, expert reports, etc. that would assist the mediator’s evaluation of the case in your favor; court orders awarding attorneys’ fees to Dale and/or other Plaintiffs’ counsel in the case.</li>
<li>Transmission: typically emailed to the mediator.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Preparing for the Mediation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have signed copies of all retainer agreements and any fee agreements with co-counsel.</li>
<li>Get your client’s approval on the settlement demand and suggest that they defer to your judgment.</li>
<li>Temper the client’s expectations. Discuss the difficult points of the case and the risks involved in opposing MSJ and taking the case to trial. Often times the client won’t realize that they may not even get a trial. Let the client know that even if they survive the MSJ and win at trial, the defense could appeal, and it could be years before anyone sees any money. Make sure they understand that the demand is a starting point, not an ending point.</li>
<li>Get an estimate of the case costs, including any costs associated with the mediation. About a week in advance, create or complete the Excel costs spreadsheet in the case folder.</li>
<li>Calculate hypothetical monetary outcomes and discuss them with your client. Make sure your client understands that the 40% contingency attorney fee and any costs will be deducted from their portion of any settlement.</li>
<li>Example: You demand $5 million knowing that $3 million would be a good settlement. There are four clients—three children of the decedent and the decedent’s mother. The mother only has a 14th amendment claim, so she would take a smaller share. The costs at the time of the mediation are $30,000. The three children each take $850,000, and the mom takes $450,000. We subtract the 40% attorney’s fees first. The three kids each pay $340,000 in attorneys’ fees, and the mom pays $180,000 in fees. Next we subtract the costs on a pro rata basis. 450,000 is 15 percent of 3 million, so the mom pays 15 percent of the costs. In this scenario, the kids each pay $8,500 in costs and the mom pays $4,500 in costs. Next, we subtract any advances given to each individual client. Let’s say we gave the mom a $10,000 advance. The NET amount left to each kid is $501,000 and the NET amount left to the mom is $255,000.</li>
<li>The client does not have to pay taxes on the settlement funds, but let the client know that you are not a tax attorney and suggest that they speak to one if they have further tax-related questions.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Assisting with the Mediation</h1>
<ul>
<li>Dale typically handles the mediations, but he may not be available for the entire mediation. Here are ways the associate can play a helpful role in the mediation:</li>
<li>Meet and confer with defense counsel to determine whether the mediation will be meaningful and productive. Mediations are required by the court, but if we know that the defense is not going to put any real offer on the table, then we will plan accordingly.
<ul>
<li>Schedule the mediation.</li>
<li>Prepare the mediation brief.</li>
<li>Prepare the client for the mediation.</li>
<li>Prepare a packet of materials for Dale to use during the mediation, including any relevant deposition transcripts and expert reports.</li>
<li>Meet the client at the mediation (if not virtual) and keep the client calm and focused during the mediation.</li>
<li>Take notes during the mediation with respect to the offers and demands. These notes will be important for follow-up discussions if the case does not settle.</li>
<li>Remain at the mediation after Dale must attend another commitment and serve as the liaison between Dale and the mediator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Consideration of Liens and Medical Bills</h1>
<ul>
<li>Where a plaintiff is injured and survives, quite often a lien will be placed on the plaintiff’s lawsuit. Do not sign the lien. Do not discuss the lien with the lienholder. However, we must advise the client prior to and during the settlement conference that the lienholder is entitled to one third of the gross settlement proceeds.</li>
<li>Example: Kaiser places a medical lien on your client’s lawsuit in the amount of $800,000. The case settles for $300,000. The lienholder is entitled to $100,000. Our office subtracts the 40% attorney fee off the top (here, $180,000), then deducts any litigation costs and advances (e.g., $10,000 in costs and $20,000 in advances), then pays off any legal funding loans the client took out against his case (e.g., $30,000), then deducts the $100,000, and then pays the client. The client in this scenario ends up with $20,000. Make sure the client is aware of this before he signs the settlement agreement and release.</li>
<li>The amount of the medical bills can create a floor for the settlement negotiations. Some of the medical bills may not be covered by the lien. Even if the client’s insurance provider paid the medical bills, you can still include them in your damage calculation on the theories that the insurance provider could collect against the client at a later date and that the client paid his insurance premiums. This is covered by the collateral source doctrine.</li>
<li>After we get the settlement check (make sure the lienholder doesn’t get its name on the check), then we can negotiate the lien down. The lienholder will usually take about 2/3 of what it thinks it’s owed.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Negotiating</h1>
<ul>
<li>Open with a demand that is 2-3 times higher than a settlement amount that you consider fair and reasonable in your case. Consider the economic and non-economic damages.</li>
<li>Don’t go down too quickly. (e.g., you open with a $5 million demand. The defense offers $50,000. Reduce your demand by $50,000).</li>
<li>Always try to keep the mid-point above the number you’d be happy walking away with.</li>
<li>Example: Your opening demand was $6 million. You would be happy walking away with $3 million. You come down too quickly, and now your last demand was $4 million, and their last offer was $1 million. Add the numbers together and divide in half. The mid-point is $2.5 million. This is lower than your desired sum of $3 million, so now you have very little room to negotiate.</li>
<li>Consider proposing a bracket that signals your mid-point.</li>
<li>Example: You open with a demand of $10 million. You would be happy walking away with $6 million. After about three hours, you’re at $8 million and the defense is at $2 million. The mid-point is $5 million. Propose a bracket that represents your mid-point. (e.g., Plaintiff proposes to reduce his demand to $7 million if Defendant brings his offer up to $5 million). In this scenario, your opening demand probably should have been higher.
<ul>
<li>Examples</li>

</ul>
<p>Plaintiff’s Demand</p>
<p>Defendant’s Offer</p>
<p>$1,500,000.00</p>
<p>$50,000.00</p>
<p>$1,450,000.00</p>
<p>$60,000.00</p>
<p>$1,440,000.00</p>
<p>“We have no further authority.”</p>
<p>“We’ll go to $1 million if you come up to $400,000.”</p>
<p>“No. I think we can knock this case out on MSJ.”</p>
<p>Plaintiff’s Demand</p>
<p>Defendant’s Offer</p>
<p>$15,000,000.00</p>
<p>$50,000.00</p>
<p>$14,500,000.00</p>
<p>$750,000.00</p>
<p>$14,000,000.00</p>
<p>$1,000,000.00</p>
<p>$13,500,000.00</p>
<p>$1,250,000.00</p>
<p>“We’ll go to $10 million if you go</p>
<p>to $5 million”</p>
<p>“Agreed.”</p>
<p>$9,500,000.00</p>
<p>$5,500,000.00</p>
<p>“We’ll go to $8 million if you go</p>
<p>to $6.5 million”</p>
<p>“Agreed.”</p>
<p>$7,750,000.00</p>
<p>$6,750,000.00</p>
<p>$7,500,000.00</p>
<p>$700,000.00</p>
<p>“I don’t think my client will take less than $7,500,000. I had a hard time getting him down to that amount. The economic damages alone are $5 million. See if you can get $7,500,00 and I’ll try to</p>
<p>talk my client into it.</p>
<p>“Let’s continue this conversation next week.”</p>
<h2>Insurance Layers</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each municipality has its own policies about when they need Board approval to settle a case. For example, the City of Los Angeles can settle a case without Board approval if the amount is under $50,000. If the amount is under $100,000 but over</p>
<ul>
<li>$50,000, then Board approval is necessary. If the amount is over $100,000, then two layers of Board approval are necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often times you’ll get to the mediation and learn that the individuals present at the mediation only have authority to offer up to a certain amount. Try to obtain this information prior to the mediation, especially if this is a private mediation that you and/or your client are paying for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most municipalities have an excess insurance carrier who will participate in the mediation if the anticipated settlement amount is more than $1,000,000. If you are setting up a mediation in a high-value case, then make sure that all the individuals responsible for opening up the pocketbook are going to attend the mediation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the Mediation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Often times the case will not settle at the mediation, but the mediation was productive enough that the parties will continue their discussions informally within the week or two after the mediation. Send a demand letter if appropriate.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the case does settle, file a notice of conditional settlement and request to vacate all dates with the court, especially if you have motions on calendar or pretrial document filing dates coming up.</li>
<li>If the settlement offer is reasonable, you may need to have follow up conversations or a face-to-face meeting with Dale to explain why taking the settlement is the best outcome for the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Settlement Agreement and Release (“SAR”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the case settles at the mediation, then the mediator will prepare an initial stipulation for settlement. This is not the final long-form agreement. Review this document with your client and check for any errors in the draft.</p>
<ul>
<li>The SAR should specify that we want the check(s) to be made out to “The Law Offices of Dale K. Galipo, Client Trust Account.” The defense often wants to put the client’s name(s) on the check. This can cause problems and delays later. If a minor’s compromise is anticipated, then that should be mentioned in the SAR and the stipulation for settlement. After the GAL makes the final annuity selection, an addendum to the SAR will be prepared detailing how the defendant will fund the annuity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Application or Motion for Approval of the Compromise of the Claims of a Minor Plaintiff</h1>
<ul>
<li>What is a Minor’s Compromise?</li>
<li>Structured settlement annuities were established in 1983 when the Periodic Payment Act was passed by Congress, giving injured Plaintiffs an alternative option to taking their entire settlement in one lump sum cash amount.
<ul>
<li>These tax-free, guaranteed annuities are unlike any typical variable or fixed annuity you may be familiar with through financial planners because this financial vehicle cannot be purchased by individuals such as yourself, nor through any broker or financial advisor whatsoever.</li>
<li>These highly regulated structured annuities are specifically tied to lawsuits and claims and are only offered during the time of settlement which is why the future payments remain 100% state &amp; federal tax-free.</li>
<li>When a case is settled with a structured annuity component, that portion of the settlement proceeds are allocated to the structured annuity establishing the future periodic payments that can be made in any way you deem suitable.</li>
<li>The structured annuity is then placed with one of only 9 top life insurance carriers in the U.S. that meet the highly regulated protocol, ratings &amp; financials required that allow them to provide this structured settlement annuity that were a component of a lawsuit or claim, for example Berkshire Hathaway, New York Life, Metropolitan Life.</li>
<li>The life company is the entity that makes all the future annuity payments either via check or direct deposit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When Do We File a Minor’s Compromise?</li>
<li>An ex parte application or regularly-noticed motion seeking the approval of the compromise of the claims of a plaintiff must be filed on behalf of any plaintiff who is under the age of 18. This applies both after a settlement and after a jury trial.
<ul>
<li>Although it is mandatory to structure the settlement funds for a minor plaintiff, keep in mind that a plaintiff does not have to be a minor in order to structure their settlement funds. If an adult plaintiff chooses to structure their settlement funds, there is no need to file anything with the court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Why Do We File a Minors’ Compromise?</li>
<li>District courts have a special duty, derived from Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 17(c), to safeguard the interests of litigants who are minors. Rule 17(c) provides, in relevant part, that a district court must appoint a guardian ad litem—or issue another appropriate order—to protect a minor or incompetent person who is unrepresented in an action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 17(c).
<ul>
<li>In the context of proposed settlements in suits involving minor plaintiffs, this special duty requires a district “court [to] conduct its own inquiry to determine whether the settlement serves the best interests of the minor.” Dacanay v. Mendoza, 573 F.2d 1075, 1080 (9th Cir. 1978); see also Salmeron v. United States, 724 F.2d 1357, 1363 (9th Cir. 1983) (holding that “a court must independently investigate and evaluate any compromise or settlement of a minor’s claims to assure itself that the minor’s interests are protected, even if the settlement has been recommended or negotiated by the minor’s parent or guardian ad litem.”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Although the district court has a special duty to safeguard the interests of minor plaintiffs, that duty requires only that the district court determine whether the net amount distributed to each minor plaintiff in the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, without regard to the proportion of the total settlement value designated for adult co-Plaintiffs and contracted by them with Plaintiffs’ counsel. If the net recovery of each minor plaintiff under the proposed settlement is fair and reasonable, the district court should approve the settlement as proposed. Robidoux v. Rosengren, 638 F.3d 1177, 1179 (9th Cir. 2011).</li>
<li>California Code of Civil Procedure Section 372 and California Rules of Court, Rule 3.1384 refer to the requirement of court approval and incorporate other rules requiring disclosure of various pertinent facts. California Rule of Court, rule 3.1384 provides that “[a] petition for court approval of a compromise or covenant not to sue under Code of Civil Procedure Section 372 must comply with rules 7.950, 7.951, and 7.952.”</li>
<li>How Do We Start the Process?</li>
<li>Prior to the mediation, temper your client’s expectations by explaining that even if the case settles for less than the client expects, the total funds to the client when the tax- free annuity pays out (particularly where the plaintiff is a young child) will be exponentially more than the amount placed in the annuity. Explain that this type of annuity is not available outside of a wrongful death lawsuit, and this is a great opportunity.
<ul>
<li>Let the client know that we have a great structured settlement broker, Melissa Baldwin, who will work with the client to structure the settlement funds.</li>
<li>Calculate the NET amount owed to the minor plaintiff following a plaintiff’s verdict and judgment at trial or a successful mediation or settlement discussions. Deduct the 40% attorney’s fees off the top, and then subtract the costs and any advances given to the plaintiff or their GAL. Include the advances in the case costs total but do not point out in the petition for minor’s compromise that we gave an advance to the GAL.</li>
<li>Example: The case settles for $600,000. There is one plaintiff, who is a minor. The costs are $20,000 and we gave the GAL a $10,000 advance. We deduct the 40% attorney’s fees ($240,000) first because that yields a greater amount to our office. Then subtract the $30,000 in costs. The NET amount to be placed into the annuity is $330,000.</li>
<li>Contact Melissa Baldwin. Provide her with the NET amount owed to the minor, the minor’s birth certificate, and contact information for the GAL. Melissa will work with the GAL to come up with a proposed distribution schedule. For example, the GAL may elect to have the annuity pay out $40,000 per year to the minor plaintiff for four years beginning the year that the minor plaintiff turns 18, and then the rest in a lump sum at the age of 30. The GAL can design any distribution schedule that works for the minor plaintiff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Petition</li>
<li>How and when to file:
<ul>
<li>The petition should be filed after the settlement has been formally approved.
<ul>
<li>The petition should be filed as an ex parte application. Filing the petition as a regularly-noticed motion may cause delays resulting in the loss of a good interest rate on the minor’s annuity.</li>
<li>Send defense counsel a copy of the petition (after checking with Dale) and get confirmation from defense counsel that they won’t be opposing the petition and won’t oppose the basis of filing the petition ex parte.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Contents of the Filing:</li>
<li>The Ex Parte Application for Approval of the Compromise of the Claims of the Minor Plaintiff(s) (“Application”) and Notice of Application, or, alternatively, a regularly-noticed motion and notice of motion.</li>
<li>The Application and accompanying Declaration must detail the following:</li>
<li>The total amount of the settlement.
<ul>
<li>How the settlement shall be divided among the plaintiffs and the attorneys.</li>
<li>The reasons why the 40% contingency fee is reasonable, based on the difficulty of the case and the risks involved.</li>
<li>The total amount of the attorneys’ fees.</li>
<li>The total amount of the costs.</li>
<li>The total costs and fees to be deducted from each plaintiff’s share of the settlement.</li>
<li>That the attorneys have not received payment from any other source on this case.</li>
<li>If the GAL is asking for a monthly stipend, that the monthly stipend will be used solely for the benefit of the GAL, and the reasons why the stipend is reasonable and necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Declaration of Dale or the attorney preparing the Application, attesting verbatim to the facts set forth in the Application.</li>
<li>Exhibits to the Declaration, as follows:</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Proposed distribution schedule prepared by Melissa Baldwin (one per minor plaintiff)</li>
<li>Documents constituting the ratings of the life insurance company that will hold the annuity, as well as a sample guarantee, all of which will be prepared by Melissa Baldwin</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Proposed Order providing the following key information:</li>
<li>How the checks will be made out, including that the check for the costs and 40% attorney’s fees, as well as any lump sum to any adult plaintiff in the case, will be made out to “The Law Offices of Dale K. Galipo, Client Trust Account”.
<ul>
<li>When the checks shall be delivered (typically 21 days after the court’s entry of the order on the minor’s compromise.</li>
<li>The distribution/payment schedule to the minor plaintiff.</li>
<li>The total amount the minor will receive after the final payment from the annuity is distributed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Alternative Proposed Order if necessary, as follows.</li>
<li>The GAL may request a monthly stipend to be paid directly to the GAL from the annuity as soon as the annuity is set up, prior to the minor turning 18. The judge will consider whether the money will be used solely for the minor plaintiff’s care. The judge may deny this request, which is why you also need to file a proposed alternative order so that you don’t have to refile a new petition later.</li>
<li>Declaration of GAL if the petition requests a monthly stipend to the GAL.</li>
<li>The declaration must support the GAL’s request for a monthly stipend, including details and exhibits (e.g., invoice for private school tuition) pertaining to how the money will be used solely for the benefit of the minor plaintiff.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Addendum and Qualified Assignment and Release (“QAR”)
<ul>
<li>Because the settlement must be approved and the SAR must be signed both prior to the court ruling on the minor’s compromise, the SAR cannot adequately specify how the distribution to the minor plaintiff will be made. For example, the judge could knock your attorney’s fees down from 40% to 30%, changing the NET amount to the minor. For that reason, an addendum to the SAR must be prepared and incorporated by reference. The SAR should state that payments shall be made pursuant to the attached addendum. Melissa typically drafts the addendum based on the proposed distribution schedule for the minor’s annuity.</li>
<li>The QAR relieves the defendant of liability from future payments and places this obligation on the life company that holds the annuity.</li>
<li>The QAR must be signed by all parties.</li>
<li>The defense MUST sign the QAR. Make sure they are aware of this ahead of time and include mandatory language regarding the signing within the SAR. Some defense counsel will try to hold things up and refuse to sign the QAR for no logical reason.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After the Ruling on the Minor’s Comp.</li>
<li>Send the order on the minor’s compromise to Melissa.
<ul>
<li>The periodic payments to the minor will begin within 3-6 months of the granting of the order.</li>
<li>The life company will send a copy of the contract and informational documents to the GAL and our office when the periodic payments begin.</li>
<li>Save copies of these documents to a safe place on the server. We need to keep these documents in the event that the client contacts us with questions about their payments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Issues that may Arise</li>
<li>Some courts or judges believe that a 40% contingency fee is too high where the plaintiff is a minor. Some judges, including Judge Phillips, will knock the fee down to 30% or 33%.
<ul>
<li>Under California Rules of Court, Rule 7.955, the attorney contingency fee relative to a minor plaintiff is capped at 25%. This is one reason we file our cases in federal court.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
