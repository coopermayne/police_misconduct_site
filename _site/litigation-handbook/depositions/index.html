<h1>Conducting Expert Depositions</h1>
<p>One of the most important deposition in a case.</p>
<h2>Purposes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Trial: get an answer to question you want to ask at trial so you don‚Äôt get an curve balls when cross examining the expert at trial.</li>
<li>Summary Judgement: get some helpful statements from their own expert. That can be persuasive in a Opposition.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Basic Strategy</h2>
<ol>
<li>Establish Bias</li>
<li>Set the standard</li>
<li>Recite helpful facts</li>
<li>Pin down answers to hypotheticals (that you want to use at trial)</li>
<li>Take away their power by getting them to admit that the jury decides whether the force was reasonable and whether to believe the officer‚Äôs testimony</li>
</ol>
<h2>Specific Checklist</h2>
<ol>
<li>Priority and timing</li>
<li>Depo notice with document production</li>
<li>Payment and other logistics</li>
<li>Areas of Questioning</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>The expert‚Äôs educational and professional background‚Äîtry to establish that he doesn‚Äôt really have the background to be making his opinions.</li>
<li>The expert‚Äôs file and what the expert reviewed prior to making his opinions‚Äîyou want to obtain the file prior to the deposition and then go through the expert‚Äôs file during a break or during the deposition. Look at 1:30sa for the expert‚Äôs notes, diagrams, and any evidence that may not have been turned over during discovery. Check to see if the expert failed to review key evidence that might change his opinions.</li>
<li>Establish bias</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>What percentage of the expert‚Äôs annual income comes from being a professional expert?</li>
<li>How often does this expert turn down cases?</li>
<li>How many other cases has this expert worked on with defense counsel?</li>
<li>How often, if ever, does he make opinions on the other side?</li>
<li>How much has the expert been paid in this case?</li>
<li>How much time has the expert spent on this case?</li>
<li>How much additional payment does he expect to receive?</li>
<li>Is this expert qualified to make his opinions?</li>
<li>What are his opinions based on? Did he review all the medical records, speak to any witnesses, and/or review the deposition transcripts?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Use the expert to reiterate the good facts of your case</li>
<li>Ask the expert hypothetical questions. Change the fact pattern in various ways to get the expert to concede, e.g., that had one disputed fact been different, then the expert‚Äôs opinion would change. For example, ‚ÄúYou would agree that had the decedent not pointed the gun at anyone, then the shooting would not have been reasonable, correct?‚Äù</li>
<li>Obtain admissions and set the standard</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>You would agree that basic police training instructs that an officer should never stand in front of a vehicle he thinks might move, correct?</li>
<li>You would agree that pursuant to basic police training, an officer can only use death in an immediate defense of life situation, correct?</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Go through the expert‚Äôs report and ask him for the bases of each of his opinions</li>
<li>Clarify the scope of the expert‚Äôs anticipated testimony at trial, including whether the expert intends to make any further opinions and whether the expert anticipates producing diagrams or other materials at trial</li>
<li>Whether the expert disagrees or agrees with the opinions of other experts in the case.</li>

<h3>Federal Law re: Privileges</h3>
<ol>
<li>Attorney-Client Privilege: This protects confidential communications between a client and an attorney made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice. It promotes open and honest communication between clients and their legal counsel.</li>
<li>Work-Product Doctrine: This privilege protects materials prepared by or for an attorney in anticipation of litigation. It ensures that attorneys can prepare for litigation without fear that their thoughts and strategies will be exposed to opposing parties.</li>
<li>Spousal Privilege: There are two distinct spousal privileges: the spousal testimonial privilege, which allows a spouse to refuse to testify against the other spouse, and the marital communications privilege, which protects confidential communications between spouses.</li>
<li>Doctor-Patient Privilege: This privilege varies widely in federal courts and may be recognized to protect confidential communications between a patient and a medical professional, depending on the circumstances.</li>
<li>Clergy-Penitent Privilege: This privilege protects confidential communications made to clergy members for the purpose of seeking spiritual guidance.</li>
<li>Psychotherapist-Patient Privilege: Recognized by the Supreme Court in Jaffee v. Redmond, this privilege protects confidential communications between a psychotherapist and a patient.</li>
<li>Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination: While not exactly an evidentiary privilege in the traditional sense, this constitutional protection allows individuals to refuse to answer questions that may incriminate them.</li>
<li>State Secrets Privilege: This privilege allows the government to resist court-ordered disclosure of information during litigation if there is a reasonable danger that such exposure would harm national security.</li>
<li>Executive Privilege: This privilege allows the executive branch of the government to resist certain subpoenas and other interventions that might impair the functions of the executive branch.</li>
<li>Trade Secrets Privilege: This privilege can protect confidential business information from disclosure.</li>

<li>and a settlement communication privilege (Evid. Code, ¬ß 1152).</li>
<li>California also allows reporters to refuse to disclose ‚Äúinformation obtained or prepared in gathering, receiving or processing of information for communication to the public.‚Äù (Evid. Code, ¬ß 1070.)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Compare California and Federal Law on Privileges</h3>
<ol>
<li>Work Product</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Protections for attorney work product also differ. California identifies any work performed by an attorney, regardless of whether litigation was contemplated, as protected work product. An attorney‚Äôs work product is absolutely privileged: ‚ÄúA writing that reflects an attorney‚Äôs impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal research or theories is not discoverable under any circumstances.‚Äù (Code Civ. Proc. ¬ß 2018.030(a).)</li>
<li>Under the federal system, protected work product is limited to matters created in anticipation of litigation. Further, Rule 26(b)(3)(A) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure allows discovery of such materials if they are relevant and the requesting party has a ‚Äúsubstantial need‚Äù to obtain them.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Spousal communications privilege</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>In California, a married person has a privilege not to testify against his or her spouse in any proceeding. (Evid. Code, ¬ß 970.) The federal common law analogy, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúthe adverse spousal testimonial privilege‚Äù is limited to criminal proceedings. See Hawkins v. United States, 358 U.S. 74, 77-78 (1958) (‚ÄúAdverse testimony given in criminal proceedings would, we think, be likely to destroy almost any marriage.‚Äù)</li>
