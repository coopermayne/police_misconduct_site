## Procedural History

In the recent decision of *Moore v. Garnand*, argued on July 12, 2023, and filed on September 29, 2023, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals navigated the complex waters of Fourth Amendment rights and the protections afforded by qualified immunity. The case, while not reported in the Federal Reporter, is documented under the Westlaw citation 2023 WL 6372972. Presiding over the matter were Judges S.R. Thomas, Bennett, and H.A. Thomas. Representation for the plaintiffs, Greg and Patricia Moore, came from attorneys Michael Garth Moore and Lawrence Jay Wulkan, while counsel Dennis P. McLaughlin argued on behalf of the defendants-appellants.

## Facts

Plaintiffs Greg and Patricia Moore lodged a 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 action against members of the Tucson Police Department. The crux of the case revolved around two search warrants linked to an investigation of arsons at properties connected to Mr. Moore, resulting in several Fourth Amendment claims. These included allegations of judicial deception to obtain the warrants, the lack of probable cause for the search and seizure, an improper arrest of Mr. Moore, and accusations of excessive force by Officer Garnand.

## Issues

The primary issue under contention was whether the officers, Sean Garnand and Dain Salisbury, violated the Moores' Fourth Amendment rights in obtaining and executing the search warrants, and if such conduct was shielded by qualified immunity, excusing the officers from liability.

## Holding(s)

The Ninth Circuit dismissed in part and affirmed in part the claims presented by the Moores. The court dismissed the claims of judicial deception, citing a lack of jurisdiction due to Defendants' failure to adequately present the facts in the plaintiffs' favor. Conversely, the court affirmed the district court's denial of qualified immunity regarding the overbroad nature of the second search warrant, which was judged to lack probable cause on its face.

## Rationale(s)

The Court of Appeals parsed the intricate details of both search warrant claims. For the first, it found that the defendants did not properly consider the plaintiffs' facts, leading to a dismissal of the qualified immunity claim on judicial deception. Regarding the second search warrant, the court held that it was overly broad, as it authorized seizure of an extensive array of financial information and electronic devices without establishing a solid probable cause that these items were connected with criminal activity. This rendered the warrant facially invalid to such a degree that any reasonable officer's reliance on it was ruled unreasonable.

## Other

The court's analysis drew a clear line on the latitude law enforcement possesses when drafting and executing search warrants. The Ninth Circuit referred to precedents that discourage issuing warrants that enable unrestrained searches and seizures, emphasizing the necessity of a foundational probable cause that narrowly tailors the warrant's scope.

The Moore v. Garnand opinion offers a salient reminder of the potent checks the judiciary holds over law enforcement practices. It asserts that the Fourth Amendment stands as a bulwark against unfounded intrusions by government officials, even in the face of doctrines like qualified immunity. Civil rights advocates may point to this decision as a reinforcement of constitutional protections and the enduring requirement that law enforcement must judiciously exercise its authority within the bounds of constitutional provisions.
