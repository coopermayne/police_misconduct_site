## Disclosure of Expert Testimony

Federal rules stipulate specific disclosures for expert testimony, including detailed reports for retained experts. These reports must articulate the expert's opinions, the data supporting these opinions, and their qualifications.

## The Timing of Expert Disclosures

The timing for disclosing expert testimony is regulated to ensure fairness. Initial disclosures and rebuttals are subject to strict deadlines, underscoring the need for strategic planning in expert engagement.

## Daubert Motions

Daubert motions serve to exclude unreliable expert testimony, based on criteria assessing the methodology's validity. These motions underscore the critical scrutiny expert evidence receives in federal court.
