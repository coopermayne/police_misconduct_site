Sending Documents to Retained Experts

1. Arguably, anything an expert reviews becomes admissible evidence in the case. Be careful what you send to the experts! Additionally, experts will charge per page or per hour for review of the materials, so be cautious not to send overly voluminous sets of documents.
2. Timing of Experts—Initial and Rebuttal
  1. Per FRCP 26—Report Needed

(2) Disclosure of Expert Testimony.

1. In General. In addition to the disclosures required by Rule 26(a)(1), a party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.
2. Witnesses Who Must Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report—prepared and signed by the witness—if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony. The report must contain:
  1. a complete statement of all opinions the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them;
  2. the facts or data considered by the witness in forming them;
  3. any exhibits that will be used to summarize or support them;
  4. the witness's qualifications, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years;
  5. a list of all other cases in which, during the previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition; and
  6. a statement of the compensation to be paid for the study and testimony in the

case.

1. Witnesses Who Do Not Provide a Written Report. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, if the witness is not required to provide a written report, this disclosure must state:
  1. the subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705; and
  2. a summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to

testify.

1. Time to Disclose Expert Testimony. A party must make these disclosures at the times and in the sequence that the court orders. Absent a stipulation or a court order, the disclosures must be made:
  1. at least 90 days before the date set for trial or for the case to be ready for trial;

or

1. if the evidence is intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party under Rule 26(a)(2)(B) or (C), within 30 days after the other party's disclosure.
2. Supplementing the Disclosure. The parties must supplement these disclosures when required under Rule 26(e).
  1. Per CCP § 2034.230—Demand Needed, No Report
3. A demand for an exchange of information concerning expert trial witnesses shall be in writing and shall identify, below the title of the case, the party making the demand. The demand shall state that it is being made under this chapter.
4. The demand shall specify the date for the exchange of lists of expert trial witnesses, expert witness declarations, and any demanded production of writings. The specified date of exchange shall be 50 days before the initial trial date, or 20 days after service of the demand, whichever is closer to the trial date, unless the court, on motion and a showing of good cause, orders an earlier or later date of exchange.
5. Order and Timing of Experts in a Non-Death Case
  1. Medical and Psych Experts—must retain early, >10-12 weeks prior to the deadline to exchange the initial expert disclosures. The medical experts will need time to review all of the medical records. Medical experts are often backed up and we need to get an appointment set early on. All medical experts will ask for one another’s reports, and the Life Care Planner will need time to review all of the medical experts’ reports.
  2. Life Care Planner—needs the medical and psych experts’ reports >6 weeks before the last day to exchange the initial expert disclosures
  3. Economist—needs the LCP >2 weeks before the last day to exchange the initial expert disclosures
6. Daubert Motions
  1. A Daubert motion is a specific type of motion in limine. It is raised before or during trial, to exclude the presentation of unqualified evidence to the jury.
  2. Under the Daubert standard, the factors that may be considered in determining whether the methodology is valid are: (1) whether the theory or technique in question can be and has been tested; (2) whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication; (3) its known or potential error rate; (4)the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation; and (5) whether it has attracted widespread acceptance within a relevant scientific community.
